In this research paper, we strive to answer our research question, "What are the impacts of US tariffs on China-US exports on EU-US exports to the US?"

We hypothesize that imposing US tariffs on Chinese goods in 2019 reduced demand for Chinese products. Due to this reduced demand, there was an increase in demand for European Union exports of the same products to the United States.

To test our hypothesis we gathered data from WITS and EUROSTATS to study the product groups, food, textiles, and capital goods in an aggregate of US dollars from 2018(when tariffs were put in place) till 2021. We used R to compile our data and create our graphs using the mean as our analytical method.

Through our research project, we found that our hypothesis was correct, however, we also discovered a couple of cavities, such as a decrease in the value of EU-US exports during 2020 due to Covid decrease in supply and demand.
